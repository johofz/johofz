- 👋 Hi, I’m @johofz
- 👀 I’m interested in building Hardware and writing Software for it. I mostly write code in C and C++ for my STM32-based projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# to build Front-Ends for my IoT and Smart-Home Projects. I always learn new things while working on projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Smart-Home, IoT and datalogging for all sorts of applications
